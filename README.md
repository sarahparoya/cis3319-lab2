### Which language and external libraries did you use?
- I used Python as my language while utilizing the socket library and DES module in Python. 

### Which IDE did you use? 
- While writing and debugging, I used Visual Studio. For actually executing the code I use the Windows Command Terminal to connect my server and client together. 

### Detailed Steps On How To Run Code [See Video]: 
- First, open up two command terminals in the folder where your code files are. 
- To run the server file, type "python server.py"
- To run the client file, type "python client.py"
- The client then connects to the server, the first message is sent from the client to the server. 
- Type your first message in the client terminal, it will then be printed out in the server terminal. It will then prompt you to write a message in the server terminal. 
- It also sends the key, the plain text message, and the cipher text of the message. 
- Once you type a message in the server terminal, it gets printed out in the client side and then prompts you to a write a message there. The communication keeps going back and forth like that. 
- To exit, in the client terminal type "bye" and the program will end.
